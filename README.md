# Pierre's Bakery Vendor Order Tracker

#### Vendor order tracker for Pierre's Bakery.

#### By Tim Roth

## Description

This Epicodus project extension builds on a prior, simpler project to allow for Pierre's Bakery to add Vendors to a list and create Orders accordingly. The project includes a splash page with links to Vendor List and Add Vendor pages. From the Vendor List page, clicking on a vendor name will take the user to the Vendor page with a list of that Vendor's orders. Clicking on an order will take you to a page with the order details.

## How to download to edit
